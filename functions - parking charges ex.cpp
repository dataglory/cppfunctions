/*
*(Parking Charges) A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
*The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours.
*The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
*Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.
*Write a program that calculates and prints the parking charges for each of three customers who parked their cars in this garage yesterday.
*You should enter the hours parked for each customer.
*Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format and should calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts.
*The program should use the function calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer.
*Your outputs should appear in the following format:

Car	Hours	Charge
1	1.5	2.00
2	4.0	2.50
3	24.0	10.00
TOTAL	29.5	14.5
